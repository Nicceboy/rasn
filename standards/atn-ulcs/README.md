# ATN Upper Layer Communications Service
This crate provides an implementation of the data types for ATN Upper Layer
Communications Service Protocol (ATN-ULCS).

Like other `rasn` core crates, this doesn't provide a client or server
but provides the core data types used to be able to create your own clients
and servers.
