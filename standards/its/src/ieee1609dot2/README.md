The standard can be found [here](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/1609.2/10258/).

The module contains `rasn` ASN.1 data structures for the IEEE 1609.2-2022 standard.
The data structures have been partially constructed with compiler, but they have been manually modified and verified to make them more usable. They also haven been modified to be more idiomatic Rust.
