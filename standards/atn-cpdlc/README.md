# ATN Controller–Pilot Data Link Communications
This crate provides an implementation of the data types for ICAO 9705
known as ATN Controller–Pilot Data Link Communications Protocol (ATN-CPDLP).

Like other `rasn` core crates, this doesn't provide a client or server
but provides the core data types used to be able to create your own clients
and servers.
